# Graph Based Recommender System

In this project we attempt to build a graph
based video recommendation system without using graph neural networks. We experiment with
three methods of link prediction: 1. using a variant of random walk, 2. generate node embeddings
using random walks for link prediction 3. employ a topology-centric framework (GELATO)
to achieve desirable results for link prediction.
We also analyse the scalability of our approach
and try to make existing work scalable to larger
graphs. We present a comparison between using
non-cluster approach and clustering the graph and
running the same methodology for the methods
mentioned previously.

For more details about the results and the methodology refer to the attached report.
